# Bakehouse Management System

An online shopping system allows the customer to order and receive products in a certain duration of time while making the purchase online. One such system is the Bakehouse Management System where the customers are entitled to order products that are available in any common Bakehouse around. This system gives access to both the Customer as well as the Administrator. The customer can view the products available and order the product accordingly. Before the payment, the products will be added into cart which can be viewed at any time during the course. Once the payment is done, the customer can also view the transactions made by him/her from the respective account. Administrator access gives admin the control to edit the products. Admin can add or delete the stock of the products as well as add new products. Admin has the control to overview the number of customers registered and the overall transactions by all of the customer. The main purpose of this system is to deliver the products required by the customers of all age and of those who are not able to go physically and make a purchase. This also helps in avoiding manual problems as the documentation is completed automated on the Administrator side.
